## Project Overview
This project is a brand-agnostic, 3-servo motion-controlled robotics automation system for sorting, collecting, and cartoning products. Designed and built end-to-end, it covers everything from embedded firmware and PLC programming to motion logic and hardware-to-HMI integration.<br>

Unlike traditional cam-based systems, this solution is 100% motion-driven, achieving:<br>

Sub-1 ms servo synchronization<br>
High precision and repeatability<br>
Scalable throughput<br>
Minimal mechanical complexity<br>

The system’s HMI is powered by the Orchestrix Framework for real-time monitoring and orchestration, while motion control runs independently on ARM-based embedded controllers and PLCs, enabling modular, lightweight, and high-performance robotic control.<br>

This project demonstrates expertise in real-time robotics, multi-axis motion control, embedded systems, and industrial automation, making it highly relevant for advanced robotics applications.<br><br>
